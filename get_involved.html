        <div>With the suspension of SNAP benefits due to the ongoing government shutdown, nearly 42 million Americans — about one in eight people — are at risk of losing access to food assistance. This is not a minor disruption; it’s an emergency.
             To meet the moment we must show up for one another in our community.

This is one among many mutual aid efforts to address the current crisis.</div>
